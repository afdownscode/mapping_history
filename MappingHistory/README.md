##Mapping History
This is an android project that began as a capstone project for a mobile development class.
The app is intended to make historical events easier to grasp by teaching them graphically with maps.
The app uses google maps api v2, you will need to get an [api key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) for app to work.
